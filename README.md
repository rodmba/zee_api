## Development

### Setup

Development happens on your local machine. We only use [Docker][docker] to provide database.

If you're using Ubuntu, run the bootstrap script to put most dependencies in place:

     $ scripts/bootstrap

This will install everything you require to compile gems and run the pre-configured Docker containers.

To actually get stuff done, install Ruby dependencies:

    $ bundle install

, and run the containers:

    $ docker-compose up

If you don't care about the wall of text it spits out, use `docker-compose up -d`.

### Sign up and Authentication

To sign up in the application use the endpoint below:

```http
POST https://rodmba-zee-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/users
```

and pass the user credentials for registration like:

```json
{ "user": {"email": "person@example.com", "password": "12345678", "password_confirmation": "12345678" } }
```

If you sign up correctly you will receive the response:

```json
{ "status": "User created successfully" }
```

To sign in the application use the endpoint below:

```http
POST https://rodmba-zee-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/users/sign_in
```

and pass the user credentials like:

```json
{ "email": "person@example.com", "password": "12345678" }
```

If you sign in correctly you will receive the response:

```json
{
    "auth_token": "some-token-to-sign-in"
}
```

After that, in every request you need to use your token inside header:

```json
Authorization: Bearer your-token-here
```
